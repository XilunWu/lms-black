* Add a black-like REPL
* Decide on correctness of MEnv argument
OK * Investigate appearances of Cont(INT_KEY) in last REPL example
* Provide guarantees in type that continuations are applied at right stage.
* Reconsider overall architecture
* Full metacontinuations instead of just meta-environments?
  Return type might need to change from R[Value] to R[MCont => Unit],
  perhaps can get away with R[MCont => Value], since Unit is problematic
  for composing generation-time with run-time continuations.
NO * Add base-apply in the environment
OK * Clean up eval tests
* better scheme than Code if inRep and asInstanceOf otherwise
OK * refactor conversion evidence generation
