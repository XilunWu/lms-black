# TODO #

- [ ] Add a black-like REPL.
- [ ] Decide on correctness of MEnv argument in generated code.
- [x] Investigate appearances of Cont(INT_KEY) in some examples.
- [ ] Provide guarantees in type that continuations are applied at right stage.
- [ ] Reconsider overall architecture
- [ ] Full metacontinuations instead of just meta-environments?
      Return type might need to change from R[Value] to R[MCont => Unit],
      perhaps can get away with R[MCont => Value], since Unit is problematic
      for composing generation-time with run-time continuations.
- [ ] Can base-apply be added in the environment?
- [ ] Find a better scheme than casting Code value if not inRep.
